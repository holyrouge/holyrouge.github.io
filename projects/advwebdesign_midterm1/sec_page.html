                    <p>
                        To get to the Met, I took the F train from the subway station near my house into Manhattan. It was really chilly outside, so I had a jacket on, but the temperature inside the train was the complete opposite and the heat made it stifling.

                    <p>
                         After a long train ride, I arrived at 86th Street subway station and walked to 81st Street and 5th Ave toward the museum. As I walked up the steps to the Met's entrance, I saw to my left a humongous poster for the Jerusalem exhibit I was about to go explore. I entered the exhibit and saw a big sign with the words "Jerusalem 1000-1400: Every People Under Heaven". The first artifact I saw in the exhibit a golden reliquary of the medieval French style from the 1300s. Then, there was a glass box containing items recovered from a merchantâ€™s hoard. It contained candlesticks, cloths, and numerous other items that might appeal to the residents of Jerusalem. At the end, I saw a gilded plate with a French emblem and Arabic script on it, showing the conglomeration of the west and the east that occurred in the Holy Land. All the items from the past took me back to the time of Crusades and to the time of a Jerusalem that was the crossroad of two worlds, the western world of Europe and the eastern world of Asia.
