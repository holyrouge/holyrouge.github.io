						<h3>The History of My Family</h3>

						<br /> <!--<br/> tags used to push the text in the <p> elements to the next line-->					
						<br />

						<p>
							My family came from humble roots in the villages and towns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_Division" target="_blank"><b>Chittagong</b></a>, Bangladesh, a small place in a small country. But, my grandparents worked hard to provide good educations for my parents, so that they could grow up to be successful and one day, move to the city. Over time, my father moved to the city and there, he married my mother. And, that's where I grew up.

						<h3>Spreading Out into the World</h3>

						<br />						
						<br />

						<p>
							Over the decades, my family has spread out across the world in search of a better life for the next generation. The first to go were my aunts, who immigrated to India with their families. My uncle and his family followed them to India soon after. 
							Then, my father won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_Immigrant_Visa" target="_blank"><b>Diversity Visa (DV) lottery</b></a> and got visas for my mother and I to move to the US. And, that's where I have lived ever since.

						<h3>In the Present</h3>

						<br />
						<br />

						<p>
							Most of my family from both father's side and my mother's side are in either the US or India. The thousands of miles of land and water between us are deafening. 
							We always look forward to the annual celebrations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja" target="_blank"><b><i>Durga Puja</i></b></a> that reunite the Ghose family. My parents and I may be content with our lives in America, but we are always a bit happier
							when the rest of family is around.
